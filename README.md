# Mathematical Problem Solving Exercises

This repository contains a set of mathematical problem-solving exercises written and solved by **Emile NIYITANGA** as part of his graduate training at **AIMS Rwanda**.

It is about proofs involving power sums, polynomial identities, and closed-form derivations.

## Topics Covered

- Sums of powers: \(\sum_{k=1}^n k^p\)
- Polynomial identities for finite sums
- Difference methods and telescoping
- Generalization using binomial coefficients
- Negative powers and the Riemann zeta function
